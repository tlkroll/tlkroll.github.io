excerpt: "Some impressions from my first week at Georgia Tech" 
---

For my first semester at Georgia Tech I enrolled in the Intro to Information Security (CS 6035) and Information Security Policies (PUBP 6725) classes. Unlike WGU, where we were encouraged to use our school projects in a portfolio, GT is very strict about not sharing any of the course material so I will not be posting anything on this site which might violate their policy. What I will say though is that so far this is a much different experience from both WGU and EGCC. No program is perfect, but so far GT seems to be a much better quality education.

Today, I completed the MITM project for CS 6035 (with a 100% score, I'm happy to report) and it was both challenging and a lot of fun. I really enjoyed that there was a narrative to follow through the entire project which gave it a sense of realism. The project included some roadblocks which one might encounter in real life and I feel that I learned a lot from it. I am excited and very much looking forward to the future projects in this course. Next up this week I'm waiting for the first assignment for PUBP 6725, which will be unlocked tomorrow. I hope it's just as much fun!
