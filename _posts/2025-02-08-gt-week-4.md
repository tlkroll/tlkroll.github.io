excerpt: "One quarter of the way through my first semester"

Since the MITM project, I've also finished Machine Learning and Binary Exploitation. Week 2 was Machine Learning, which was very difficult and took up a lot of my time even though my capstone project at WGU was very similar. This project felt a bit out of place for this course and did not have much to do with cybersecurity.

Weeks 3 and 4 were Binary Exploitation, which was incredible. I learned a lot more about my favorite security subjects during this project. Not only did I earn 100% on the regular project, but got through all of the extra credit except for the final call on the final task and now I'm out of time (it's making a system call to cat /proc/flag, but just won't go through!). These two weeks reinforced that this is the direction I want to take with my career. I wish I could post write-ups about what I've learned, but it would violate Georgia Tech's rules on academic integrity.

For the first group project in PUBP 6725 I was tasked with sending a spoofed email. I also learned a lot about this subject and would like to research it further. This project made me want to apply for a public IP and set up an SMTP server at home!
