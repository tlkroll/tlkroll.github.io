excerpt: "Jupyter Notebook with Python and machine learning to predict arena match outcomes" 
---
This was my capstone project at WGU. Sometimes I have a hard time coming up with a topic for a fictional project like this one and in this case I just used the first Kaggle dataset that looked interesting to me. I used to play World of Warcraft, so I was familiar with the topic and thought it would be a fun project. I thought that arena matches may be easy to predict based on class or class combination, but I was surprised to learn that race was the best predictor of a match outcome.
