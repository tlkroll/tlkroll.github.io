excerpt: "CS6035 Cryptography Project"

Well, the cryptography project wraps up tomorrow and that was a tough one! I had a rudimentary understanding of RSA encryption from my Discrete Math 2 course where we encrypted and decrypted RSA by hand using the Extended Euclidean Algorithm, but this project went much deeper. I learned some interesting tricks with Python and math in general when it comes to cryptography and I have a much better grasp of the subject now. Cryptography is an interesting subject and I'm fairly comfortable with it now, but from this project I can tell it's not something that would hold my interest long-term. Still very interested in Assembly and binary exploitation! 

Almost done with PUBP6725 as well. Public policy is also not my thing, but the end is in sight! Thankfully the rest of the classes in this program are all technical!
