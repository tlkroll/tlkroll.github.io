excerpt: "Logisim project for my Computer Architecture course"

This will feature my Logisim project from school where I had to design an ALU. However, posting this is turning out to be a bit of a project on its own. I want to have an interactive app embedded in this page instead of just screenshots, but that is proving to be quite a challenge. I have Logisim running in the browser now, but now I need to figure out a way it can access the project file. To be continued... 

{% include logisim.html %}
