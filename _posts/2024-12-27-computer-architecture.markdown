excerpt: "Logisim project for my Computer Architecture course" 
---
For the final project in my Computer Architecture course I had to design an ALU in Logisim. This was a great way to learn how logic gates are used in a practical application and how they interact with the binary numbering system. Below, I've linked a modified version of Logisim which loads my assignment file and is run from inside the browser, which was a project in itself to create. On the left, there is a list of circuit diagrams. The first, "ALU", includes everything in the finished project, but you can scroll through and select another from the list to see the many individual operations.
