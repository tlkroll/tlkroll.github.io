excerpt: "Completed CS6035 and PUBP6725" 
---

All assignments have been completed for my first two classes at Georgia Tech! The last assignment for CS6035 was Database Security. This project was much harder than expected, but also a lot more fun. I loved the reverse engineering aspects of trying to bypass the input sanitization. I finished this class with a grade of 101!

I'm not crazy about the PUBP6725 class. Honestly, I didn't learn much more than I did in my associate-level security class. Unfortunately the group projects for this class dragged my grade down quite a bit and I ended up with an 89 (which according to the reviews on omscentral.com is very common... hmmmm). This class was more akin to a business course and I find it odd that students purusing technical degrees would be required to take it at the graduate level. At least the rest of the classes in my program are technical!

I have a couple weeks off now and then I'll start CS6250 Computer Networks for the summer. I already possess a CCNA, but it sounds like there will still be a lot for me to learn. In preparation for this I finally posted my subnetting write-up that has been in the back of my brain for several years now. After this in the fall I'll be taking CS6747 Advanced Malware Analysis. I can't wait for that one!
