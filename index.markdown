<p>My name is Tom Kroll and I am currently a graduate student in Georgia Tech's OMS Cybersecurity program.</p> 

<p>During my time as a computer science undergraduate, I enjoyed classes focused on low-level topics such as computer architecture, memory management, and all the incredible things that can be done with the binary numbering system. My favorite subjects in cybersecurity are reverse engineering and binary exploitation and my goal is to break into the tech field and work my way up to a job where I can use these skills every day, such as malware analysis or application security.</p>

<p>My goal for this page is to create a space where I can document projects I'm working on, CTF write-ups, and any programs I've written. In addition to this, it's giving me some good practice with Git and front-end development.</p>

<p>Enjoy! I hope this site gives anyone reading this some good learning opportunities as well!</p>
