<p>My name is Tom Kroll and I am an independent security researcher/bug bounty hunter. I am also a graduate student in Georgia Tech's OMS Cybersecurity program.</p> 

<p>During my time as a computer science undergraduate, I enjoyed classes focused on low-level topics such as computer architecture, memory management, operating systems, and all the incredible things that can be done with the binary numbering system. My favorite subjects in cybersecurity are reverse engineering and binary exploitation and my goal is to transition from freelance security research into a full-time job where I can use these skills every day, such as malware analysis or application security.</p>

<p>My goal for this page is to create a space where I can document projects I'm working on, CTF write-ups, and programs I've written. In addition to this, it's giving me some good practice with Git and front-end development.</p>

<p>Enjoy! I hope this site gives anyone reading this some good opportunities to learn as well!</p>
